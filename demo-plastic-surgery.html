        <p>
          It's normal to have doubts. Surgery is a big step. Not everyone is ready, and that's okay. 
          We're here to help you figure out what's right for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Surgery may be a good fit if you:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have a clear goal and realistic expectations</li>
          <li>Are in good health and don't smoke</li>
          <li>Want to feel more confident in your body</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Surgery may not be right if you:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expect perfection or a total transformation</li>
          <li>Are doing it to please someone else</li>
          <li>Have health issues that make surgery risky</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Not sure? That's what the consult is for. We'll talk it through together.
